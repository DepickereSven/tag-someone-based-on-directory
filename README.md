# Tag someone based on directory

> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that Tags someone based on code changes in a certain folder

## Information

Certain people need to review certain code changes so instead you as a person tagging them to ask for a review. \
We have a bot that can do this for you!

## Usage

There are a couple of configuration options that you will need to set up depending on what you want.

```yml
personToTag: UserNameOfPerson # This is the user you want to tag to send the comment to
regexPath: (api\/) # If something changed in this folder we will post comment asking the user to verify the changes
```
